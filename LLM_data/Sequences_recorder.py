        A state represented as a list containing multiple strings, where each string signifies an "idea unit" (a single concept or perception of an individualâ€™s external and internal world).
        
        Task:
        Analyze each string within the state, ensuring it is condensed into the smallest possible "idea unit".
        If a string can be divided, split it into individual words or phrases, ensuring they do not construct sentences.
        Ensure that any adjectives remains unchanged (e.g., "cloudy" becomes "cloudy", "interesting" becomes "interesting").
        Ensure that any verb is presented in its base form (e.g., "took" becomes "take", "ordering" becomes "order").
        Ensure that any plural noun is converted to its singular form (e.g., "windows" becomes "window").
        Replace the original strings with the split words or phrases.
        Keep all other aspects unchanged and return the modified data in the same list format.
        
        For instance, if the input is:
        ['taking out wallet', 'sad', 'windows', 'the weather is sunny', 'table', 'ordering', 'standing in a coffee shop', 'I feel anxiety']
        The modified state should be in the following format:
        ['take out', 'coffee shop', 'wallet', 'sad', 'window', 'sunny', 'table', 'order', 'stand', 'anxiety']
        
        Now consider the state:
        {str(state)}
        Provide me the modified state

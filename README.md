# **What is this**

This repo is for my naive general psychology model, will help building understand of narrative comprehension and other psychological phenomena:+1:. The ideas of the model can be found in [my shitty website](https://angushushu.com)

There are multiple ways to implement it. Integrated implemention may lead to some confusion and difficulty on interpretation, thus I'm currently focusing on the 3 Graphs Implementation. The model is consist of 3 interdependent graphs: representation graph, action graph, and state-action graph.

## Task list
- [x] Basic features of the rep graph
- [x] Graph demonstration
- [x] Simple test script
- [x] Activation of reps in rep graph
- [x] Spreading of activation in rep graph (forward & backward)
- [x] Cohort generation mechanism
- [ ] Union of reps
- [ ] Intersect of reps
- [ ] Basic features of the act graph

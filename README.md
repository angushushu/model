# **What is this**

This repository contains my preliminary general psychology model, which aims to aid in understanding narrative comprehension and other psychological phenomena.üëç The core ideas of the model can be explored on [my shitty website](https://angushushu.com).

While there are various ways to implement this model, an integrated approach might lead to some confusion and challenges in interpretation. Hence, I'm currently concentrating on the 3 Graphs Implementation. The model comprises three interdependent graphs: the representation graph, action graph, and state-action graph. Recently I started considering a new way of representing actions and state-action chains, that is, using a network. ‚ö†Ô∏è Notice, none of these is done.
